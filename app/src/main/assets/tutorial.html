        <span class="header">Goal</span>
        <p>
            To score points, place six pieces into pies to create complete circles. In order to
            successfully place a piece, there must be an open section of the pie that matches
            the shape of the piece. Do this as quickly as you can, the clock is ticking!
        </p>

        <span class="header">Scoring</span>
        <p>
            When you complete a pie, you get 60 points (10 points per piece). If all of the pieces
            are the same color, the score increases to 120 points (20 points per piece).
        </p>

        <span class="header">Power Ups</span>
        <p>
            When you complete a pie with a single color that has a power up above it, that power up
            immediately becomes available. The three power ups are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>2x</i>:
                    all points you score while this power up is active will be multiplied by 2.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>The Bomb</i>:
                    tapping this power up will clear the game board of all pieces. You will receive
                    no points for the pieces cleared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Slow Down</i>:
                    slows down the speed of the piece timer by 50%.
                </li>
            </ul>
            All power ups are valid for 15 seconds.
        </p>

        <span class="header">Lives</span>
        <p>
            Every time you complete a pie with pieces of a single color, you gain one life. Every
            time you fail to place a piece, or skip a piece by tapping the center pie, you lose one
            life.
        </p>

        <span class="header">Tips</span>
        <p>
            Some aspects of game play can be tweaked in the Settings screen.<br>
            If you want to end a game in a hurry, press and hold on the <i>Pause</i> button.
